#Lead in drinking water data

The data file (lead_violations.csv) contains all violations for mandatory lead testing under the EPA’s Lead and Copper Rule for public water systems across the U.S. between January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2016. The violations were reported by state and federal regulators during the 3rd quarter 2016 to EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) database. The file contains more than 14,500 lead test violations from nearly 9,700 systems of varying size. A quarter of those systems reported multiple violations over the 6 ½-year analysis period. 

##Fields

Here are descriptions of the fields found in the data file:

-	PWS ID: The unique ID number assigned by the EPA to each public water system. Sort by the ID field to find multiple violations for a system during the analysis period. 
- PWS Name: The registered name of the public water system.
- Primary Agency: The primary agency that regulates a system’s mandatory lead testing. Typically, the system is regulated by the state environmental agency in which it is located. Systems located on tribal land or reservations are regulated by the EPA regional office in their area.
- Population Served: The estimated number of customers in the area served by the water system.
- Violation Type: The specific lead test violation cited by the regulating agency. The USA TODAY analysis includes two citations under the Lead and Copper Rule: Violation 51 (a system failing to do an initial tap water sample test for lead) and Violation 52 (a system failing to do a follow-up lead test after an initial test that doesn’t meet standards). 
- Compliant Period Begin Date: The start date of the cycle in which a water system must complete lead testing that meets EPA standards. Testing cycles may vary from six months to three years, depending on the system’s test history. 
- Compliance Status: The current status of a violation. “Open” status means the system has not completed a lead test since the citation was issued. “Returned to compliance” means the system has completed a test since the violation, fulfilling the EPA requirement.
