#Fatal Police Chases Data

The data file [fatal_pursuits_2013-2014.csv](fatal_pursuits_2013-2014.csv) contains a listing of every fatal police pursuit in the United States in 2013 and 2014. USA TODAY assembled the list using crash data reported to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as well as police reports, court documents and news accounts.

The records show that black people die in police chases at a rate far higher than do people of other races, and that deadly chases of black drivers were more likely to begin with officers observing seemingly minor offenses that posed little danger to the public.
